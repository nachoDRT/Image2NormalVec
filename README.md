# Image2NormalVec
This GitHub repository offers a solution for picking parts with a robotic arm, even when the parts vary in position. It provides an algorithm that extracts the normal vector from an input image. By accurately identifying the orientation of the picking point, the robot improves the efficiency and precision of the picking process.
